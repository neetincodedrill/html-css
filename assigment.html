                                 A lot of executive coaching fails because the client is told what to do and to replace 
                                 their current methods and techinque.Unfortunately,human beings are creatures of
                                 habit and insecurity.Usually, we all revert to old behaviours,so the new way gets
                                 lost.

                         <b>Reorganising the mind</b>
                             Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and communicator by
                             using a series of psychological techniques that once employed and embedded,
                             strengthen your ability over time.Good coaching is about changing your mind on a
                             fundamental level rather than showing you what to do.Real growth is
                             psychologiacl.The physical will follow.He will teach you technique not by telling
                             you what to do but by giving you solution that are embedded themseleves in your
                             thinking.Over time,many of the things you thought were beyond possibility
                             become easy and natural.
